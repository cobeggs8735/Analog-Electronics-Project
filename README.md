# Analog-Electronics-Project
Final project conducted for the Analog Electronics class (ESET 350) in the Engineering Technology and Industrial Distribution class at Texas A&amp;M University. 

## Summary
The .ms14 file extension is typically associated with Multisim, which is circuit simulation software provided by National Instruments. Files with this extension usually contain electronic circuit schematics, components, wiring, and simulation settings.

This means the file [FinalProject.ms14](Project-Files/FinalProject.ms14) contains the schematic and simulation setup for Analog Electronics final projectâ€”representing the design and the testing of a funcction generator analog circuit. To see the details (such as which components are used and how the circuit works), you will need to open this file in NI Multisim.
